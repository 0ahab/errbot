Release history
===============

Version 1.1.0 (2012-17-06)
--------------------------

Added the !uptime command
!uninstall doesn't require a full restart anymore
!update a plugin doesn't require a full restart anymore
Simplified the usage of the asynchronous self.send() by stripping the last part of the JID for chatrooms
Improved the !restart feature so err.py is standalone now (no need to have a err.sh anymore)
err.py now takes 2 optional parameters : -d to daemonize it and -c to specify the location of the config file

Version 1.0.4 (2012-17-04)
--------------------------

First real release, fixups for Pypi compliance.
