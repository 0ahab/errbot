Flows Intro
===========

Errbot can define commands pretty easily but once you start to try
combining commands, things can get hairy because you need to track
the state of a conversation within every command.

Errbot flows allow you to reuse a command in a conversation and keeps
track for you at what step your users are.

Prior knowledge
---------------

Before starting, you'll need to be familiar with writing plugins for
Errbot.
